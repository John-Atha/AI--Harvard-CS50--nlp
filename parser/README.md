## Project 6a - Parser

* An AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases


### Implementation

* We use a context free grammar and repeatedly apply rewriting rules to replace non-terminal with terminal symbols
* The goal was to implement the `preprocess` and `np_chunk` functions, and complete the set of rewriting rules `NONTERMINALS`
